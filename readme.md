How to make it work:

> We work with mysql. You can make changes to your database but please make charges to the config files also.

1. Create a database with the following settings:
Name: projectdb
2. Create a user if there is'nt arleady with the following:
Name:root
password:NULL (No password)
and all the rights.
3. Insert the data form the following files according to the order given:
    projectDB.sql
    costumer.sql
4. You have to add the folder DB to your local php web server. We used XAMP so we added it to xampp\htdocs folder.
